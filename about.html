    <blockquote class="about">
        <b class="text">Honesty</b>, <b class="text">loyalty</b>, <b class="text">respect</b>, <b class="text">integrity</b> and <b class="text">dedication</b> 
        are what I believe to be the most important values to me. I always hope to have good relationships with people who have those same values
        because without them, the world would be chaotic and unhinged. In referencing saving the earth, respect and integrity for our own planet is very important.
        If we do not respect the planet that we live on and hold our own integrity in protecting and taking care of it, we would be digging our own graves.

    <blockquote class="expl">I started my exercising journey around mid 2020 during lockdown when Covid-19 was at its peak.
        I started doing calisthenics and cardio which set a good base of stamina and muscle ontop of my growth spurt during that time.
        Exercising has also helped me get more active and when I go for runs, I actually help pick up the litter on my path if I see a trash bin nearby.
        This has been going on since the time I started exercising and so I feel I have actually helped save our environment a slight bit.

    <blockquote class="expl"><i><b class="apex">Apex Legends</b></i> is a battle royale game with characters called legends having unqiue skills and abilities.
        The legend I am known for using is called <b id="rampart">Rampart</b> and she can build walls for defense and for increasing bullet damage when shot through the defending side.
        <i><b class="apex">Apex Legend</b></i> is the only Multiplayer First-person-shooter that I consistently play. With over <b>400 hours</b> and many different skills acquired, I am able to play at an above average level than normal people.

    <blockquote class="expl">My love for cooking came from my Mother when she got me to help her cook from young. Cooking is like therapy for me,
        it is soothing and relaxing and I find myself not having to think while I cook which allows me to relax and unwind. 
        People tend to over-complicate cooking when it actually is quite simple and only requires time to improve at. Cooking also helps save on resources on take-out food.
        I do not need to use styrofoam containers and plastic utensils which helps lower the waste production from the food industry.
